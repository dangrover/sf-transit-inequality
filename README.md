Inequality & Mass Transit in the Bay Area
=====================

This is a mashup to overlay demographic info with the all the major mass transit routes in the San Francisco Bay Area.

This **master** branch youâ€™re looking at has the Python code used to generate the data files used by the visualization.. The visualization itself is in the **gh-pages** branch.

### Running locally for forking/development

To run the Javascript app locally for experimentation and forking, use a simple web server to serve the necessary assets (CSS, JSON, JS).

One easy way to do this is with the [one-line Python web server](http://www.garyrobinson.net/2004/03/one_line_python.html). To do this:

    # Go into the repo directory
    cd sf-transit-inequality
    # Check out the gh-pages branch
    git checkout gh-pages
    # Launch the Python server
    # In Python 2.x
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    # OR, in Python 3.x
    python -m http.server 8000

Then open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

### Modifying for other cities and demographic data
To generate the JSON file that the mashup reads data from, run grab_routes.py. 

To change it to graph another city, change ALL_GTFS_PATHS in config.py to point to other GTFS feeds available from the transit agency of your choice. 

To graph other dimensions, change the MEDIAN_INCOME_TABLE_NAME constant to some other American Community Survey column name. More info available at census.gov. Also, be sure to use your own API key!
